## Pocket Plumbers Theme Specification

### Overall Look and Feel
Pocket Plumbers pays homage to classic Gameboy Color visuals while leveraging modern design principles for clarity and accessibility. The interface mimics pixelated charm and limited color palettes but uses cleaner typography, contemporary layout spacing, and subtle micro-interactions. All interactive elements and call-to-action accents use a retro-inspired green. Cards, buttons, and stat windows call back to cartridge labels and game menus, with soft shadows and border radii adding a welcoming, modern touch.

### Core Palette
- **Primary (Action) Color:** `emerald-500` (`bg-emerald-500`, `text-emerald-500`, `border-emerald-500`)
- **Dark Ground:** `gray-900` / `gray-800`
- **Light Backgrounds:** `gray-100`, `white`
- **Accent Borders/Dividers:** `gray-200`
- **Pixel Shadow Accent:** Vibrant contrast, e.g., `yellow-300`, `lime-400`
- **Button & Selection Highlight:** `emerald-600`, `emerald-400`

### Typography
- **Font Family:** `font-mono` (for pixel/Gameboy effect), occasionally `font-sans` for announcements or body
- **Uppercase Labels:** `uppercase`, `tracking-wider`
- **Heading Style:** `text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold`
- **Subtle Shadow:** `drop-shadow-[0_1px_0_rgba(0,0,0,0.8)]` (simulates pixel text highlight)

## Thematic Details

- Rounded edges (`rounded-lg`, `rounded-md`) on all core UI elements.
- Shadow effects (`shadow`, `shadow-lg`, etc.) suggest the chunky, layered look of early handheld interface dividers.
- Thin solid borders (`border-2`, `border`, `border-emerald-500`) on cards/buttons for the Gameboy look.
- Use of `uppercase tracking-wider` (and `tracking-widest` for more dramatic effect) on all labels, buttons, and headings.
- Flashy actions (rewards popups, critical fixes) use emerald gradients and pixelated burst SVGs.
- Subtle transition effects (`transition`, `hover:*`) maintain a responsive, modern UI feel.

### Summary

This theme blends a retro, pixel-inspired Gameboy color vibe—channeling nostalgia—while updating the interface for contemporary clarity and usability through Tailwind utilities. Emerald green stands out as the world’s core energy, used consistently for buttons, highlights, and progress bars, helping all “action” interactions pop vividly.
