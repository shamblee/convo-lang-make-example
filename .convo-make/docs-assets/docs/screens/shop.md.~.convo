## Pocket Plumbers Theme Specification

### Overall Look and Feel
Pocket Plumbers pays homage to classic Gameboy Color visuals while leveraging modern design principles for clarity and accessibility. The interface mimics pixelated charm and limited color palettes but uses cleaner typography, contemporary layout spacing, and subtle micro-interactions. All interactive elements and call-to-action accents use a retro-inspired green. Cards, buttons, and stat windows call back to cartridge labels and game menus, with soft shadows and border radii adding a welcoming, modern touch.

### Core Palette
- **Primary (Action) Color:** `emerald-500` (`bg-emerald-500`, `text-emerald-500`, `border-emerald-500`)
- **Dark Ground:** `gray-900` / `gray-800`
- **Light Backgrounds:** `gray-100`, `white`
- **Accent Borders/Dividers:** `gray-200`
- **Pixel Shadow Accent:** Vibrant contrast, e.g., `yellow-300`, `lime-400`
- **Button & Selection Highlight:** `emerald-600`, `emerald-400`

### Typography
- **Font Family:** `font-mono` (for pixel/Gameboy effect), occasionally `font-sans` for announcements or body
- **Uppercase Labels:** `uppercase`, `tracking-wider`
- **Heading Style:** `text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold`
- **Subtle Shadow:** `drop-shadow-[0_1px_0_rgba(0,0,0,0.8)]` (simulates pixel text highlight)

- Use of `uppercase tracking-wider` (and `tracking-widest` for more dramatic effect) on all labels, buttons, and headings.
- Flashy actions (rewards popups, critical fixes) use emerald gradients and pixelated burst SVGs.
- Subtle transition effects (`transition`, `hover:*`) maintain a responsive, modern UI feel.

### Summary

This theme blends a retro, pixel-inspired Gameboy color vibe—channeling nostalgia—while updating the interface for contemporary clarity and usability through Tailwind utilities.

# Card Shop

The **Card Shop** is the bustling heart of collection-building in Pocket Plumbers. Here, players use their hard-earned coins to buy fresh card packs, snipe rare single cards, and barter with others through a vibrant marketplace—all with a distinctly retro, Gameboy-inspired interface.

---

## Layout & Structure

### Overall View

The shop fills the screen with a lively, well-organized grid featuring themed shop sections, engaging pixel flourishes, and clear coin balances. It uses a soft, high-contrast palette: a light-to-emerald vertical gradient background with a pixel grid overlay, providing playful energy and focus to shopping activities. The shop’s main content is contained within a rounded, bordered, and subtly shadowed panel centered on the screen, recalling classic game menu boxes.

### Sections

#### 1. Shop Header

  - Animated coin or pixel-burst icon next to the title for atmosphere.
  - Player **Coin Balance** displayed prominently; mono font, bold, emerald-highlighted.

#### 2. Shop Tabs

- **Functionality:** Players can quickly switch between three core shop modes:
  - **Card Packs** (default): Buy randomized packs of cards.
  - **Single Cards**: Pick individual cards from rotating daily offers.
  - **Trades**: See open trades or post cards to swap with other players.

- **Style:**  
  - Horizontal tab bar, each tab a pill-shaped emerald-outlined button (`rounded-full border-emerald-400 uppercase`).
  - Active tab uses solid emerald fill (`bg-emerald-500 text-white`); inactive tabs are outline-only.
  - Smooth hover transitions as you mouse over tabs.

#### 3. Card Packs Section

  - Grid layout: Featured card packs are arranged as oversized cards or tiles.
  - Each pack tile shows artwork, pack name, number of cards, theme, and price in coins.
  - **Purchase button:** Emerald, large, with coin icon.
  - **Pack details** (rarity odds, included card types) appear on tile hover/tap.

- **Specials:**  
  - Daily or weekly rotating "Special Pack" highlighted with a glowing emerald border or pixel-burst effect.
  - Limited-time offers use badge overlays (e.g., `LIMITED!` in yellow/lime).

#### 4. Single Card Offers

  - Vertical or grid list of individual cards available for direct purchase.
  - Each card mini-panel:
    - Pixel-art illustration.
    - Card name and rarity.

    - Requested card(s) or coin price.
    - Player name/avatar (pixel-style).
    - "Trade" button (emerald), or "Post Trade" for your own requests.

- **Empty State:**  
  - If few trades exist, display a friendly, pixel-plumber mascot with encouragement to post a trade.

- **Placement:** Between shop header and tabs or floating at the top.
- **Contents:**  
  - Flashes current daily deal, flash discounts, or event packs (e.g., "Leak Week Special!").

  - Central floating, emerald-outlined modal with bold title.
  - Shows animated reveal of purchased cards, or confirmation of trade.
  - "Close" and "Buy More" (emerald, bold) actions at bottom.
